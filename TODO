- using n (degree) & d (# digits) to control data in general-form polynomials
- find way to store this data (coefficients, n, d) in separate file for use among each of the three algorithms

PROTOTYPES:

generateCoeff(n,d)
- generates n+1 coefficients to use for the algorithms
- these coefficients must be of size d
- both the coefficients & n should be output to file

(driver should read coefficients & n from file, then feed to algorithm. Let x be some value)
algorithm1(coefficients,x,n)
- should evaluate to & return some number without overflow
- display response time

(SAME FOR ALGIRHTMS 2 and 3)
