- using n (degree) & d (# digits) to control data in general-form polynomials
- find way to store this data (coefficients, n, d) in separate file for use among each of the three algorithms

PROTOTYPES:

generateCoeff(n,d)
- generates n+1 coefficients to use for the algorithms
- these coefficients must be of size d
- both the coefficients & n should be output to file

(driver should read coefficients & n from file, then feed to algorithm. Let x be some value)
algorithm1(coefficients,x,n)
- should evaluate to & return some number without overflow
- display response time

(SAME FOR ALGIRHTMS 2 and 3)


PSEUDOCODE:

DRIVER:
    MENU:
        1. GENERATE NEW DATA
        2. USE EXISTING DATA
    (1) DO:
        ASK FOR N and D
        PASS N and D TO GENERATE COEFF&VAR TO UPDATE DATA
    (2) SKIP...

    INITIALIZE VECTOR TO HOLD COEFFICIENTS & X
    VERIFY THAT VECTOR & X CONTAINS VALUES

    MENU:
        1. BRUTE
        2. REPEATED
        3. HORNERS
    
    (1 | 2 | 3) DO:
        PASS IN VECTOR OF COEFF TO ALGORITHM 
        START TIMER
        EVALUATES
        END TIMER

GENERATE VAR&COEFF:
    OPEN FILE FOR WRITING
    FOR N+1 ITERATIONS:
        GENERATE RANDOM # & CONVERT TO DIGIT SIZE D
        WRITE TO FILE
    CLOSE FILE
